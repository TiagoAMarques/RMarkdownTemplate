This is a readme file for RMarkdownTemplate, a template hosted at 

https://github.com/TiagoAMarques/RMarkdownTemplate

The objective of this repository is to provide a hands on easy going introduction to a relatively elaboarte template for RMarkdown documents, which will allow you to be using dynamic reports in a heart beat.

Instructions: download all the files into a folder (you might not need them all, but that makes sure you have all you might need!). Then simply open the file RMarkdownTemplate.Rmd and knit it under your RStudio session. Explore the results to see what does what, and then expand it and customize it to your needs.

A bit mnore detail:

The main file is RMarkdownTemplate.Rmd. All the other files are just required for the above file to compile adequately.

The purpose of this repository is to hold a RMarkdown template that can be used as a hands-on example for begginers learning RMarkdown. RMarkdown can be extremelly useful but also a bit complicated at first. With this document even if you do not know anything about it you can hit the groud running and adapting this template for your own dynamic reports.

If you are unsure how to use this template, follow the visual step-by-step instructions in the file "StepByStep.pptx", which also includes some tips about how to add new references to the .bib file to generate automatic bibliografies.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to send them my way via the git way or via email tiago.marques@st.andrews.ac.uk

Have fun "kniting"!

You need to know your way around R studio to use this template, and if that is not your case (yet!), you might find this companion tutorial with an intro to R and R Studio useful
