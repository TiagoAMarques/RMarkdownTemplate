This is a readme file for RMarkdownTemplate.

This is intendend as a simple repository which main file is RMarkdownTemplate.Rmd. All the other files are just required for the above file to compile adequately.

The purpose of this repository is to hold a RMarkdown template that can be used as a hands-on example for begginers learning RMarkdown. RMarkdown can be extremelly useful but also a bit complicated at first.With this document even if you do not know anything about it you can hit the groud running and adapting this template for your own dynamic reports.

Simply open the file RMarkdownTemplate.Rmd and knit it under your RStudio session. Explore the results to see what does what, and then expand it to your needs.

And if you have any suggestions, feel free to send them my way via the git way or via email tiago.marques@st.andrews.ac.uk
